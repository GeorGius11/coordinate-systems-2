# Signal Processing with Node.js

This project demonstrates basic signal processing techniques in Node.js, including the generation and filtering of signals, noise addition, autocorrelation, and Fourier Transform analysis. It uses `fft-js` for FFT computations and `nodeplotlib` for plotting.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
node index.js
```
